# Use Multiple SSH Keys For Separate GitHub Accounts

## Why?

Let's say you have two GitHub accounts:

1. An account for personal projects
2. An account for work under a different email address
    ( which may or may not be an Enterprise account )

I have two GitHub accounts, a personal one and an Enterprise one that I use for
work, and wanted to have separate SSH keys for each account because why not
